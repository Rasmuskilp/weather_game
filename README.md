#how to play the game instructions

Three files : the testing file, the function file and the game code file.

run the game code file for the actual game.

call function

enter an int value as requested

the function will tell you if it is an remainder of 3 or 5 or both

the game_functions file collets all the functions that are necessary for the game function to work

the test file runs a series of tests to confirm whether the game is working as intended

#Ideas implemented

Used TDD to build the code

Kept in mind the separation of concern principle

Utilised README to contain all the necessary documentation for the whole project
